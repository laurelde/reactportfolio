I utilized good user interface design practices,\n            including Gestalt principles of orientation and similarity to allow\n            users to easily understand how information on each page is related.\n            With consistent branding throughout the app, the HDC on Campus\n            prototype seamlessly extends the Hagerty brand and community to\n            college students.\n          </p>\n\n          <img\n            src=\"images/prototyping/deliverables.jpg\"\n            className=\"center-block\"\n            id=\"wireframing-hdc\"\n          ></img>\n\n          <h2>Solution:</h2>\n          <p>\n            Create a centralized connection between Hagerty Driver's Club on\n            Campus as well as full-time HDC members in the form of an accessible\n            mobile application.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default HDCReport;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
